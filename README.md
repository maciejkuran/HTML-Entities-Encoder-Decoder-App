The HTML character encoder converts all reserved characters to their corresponding HTML entities, and the decoder does it the other way. 'Some special characters are reserved for use in HTML, meaning that your browser will parse them as HTML code. For example, if you use the less-than (&lt;) sign, the browser interprets any text that follows as a tag. To display these characters as text, replace them with their corresponding character entities, as shown in the following table.' - [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Entity).
